Advance CSS Challenge 6/26/2024

Today I coded together a web profolio to demostarte my talets as a coder. Highlighting pass accomplishments.

Description
This project's main focus was on CSS. I had to use many of my skills I picked up this week, like Flex box and media inqueries. 
Starting from scratch was a bit more challenging, but I was able to use wireframes to help guid the process.
