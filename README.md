Advance CSS Challenge 6/26/2024

Today I coded together a web profolio to demonstrate my talents as a coder. Highlighting my pass accomplishments.

This project's main focus was on CSS. I had to use the skills I picked up over this week, like Flex box and media inqueries. 
Starting from scratch was a bit more challenging, but I was able to use wireframes to help guid the process.
